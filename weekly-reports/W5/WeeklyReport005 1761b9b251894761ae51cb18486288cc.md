This week I followed the tutorial and completed the basic setup of Photon 2. Cuz I have less experience in hardware area. So I feel like there are a lot of things to learn and catch up, it is a exciting challenge for me and I am looking forward to make interesting things in this project!

But now I still not figure out what is different between Photon2 and Arduino, maybe the Photon2 is base on the internet controll platform that could be connected to others.
