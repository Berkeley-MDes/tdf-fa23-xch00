Hi, I am Clara, used to study architecture design.

**Demonstration:**

I conducted a more in-depth analysis of the phone stand from a computational design perspective and contemplated using computational methods for topology optimization of the support structure.

**Challenges & Personalization**

**Challenge Level**

03-Axolotl

**Description of the challenges:**

I chose Axolotl as the challenge level because I have introduced topology optimization as a concept in the actual production of mobile phone stands. The practical significance of topology optimization in computational design motivated me to incorporate it into the product design process. It can help improve the efficiency, performance, and sustainability of products and structures, thus aiding in cost reduction and resource conservation.

First, I baked the model from the TJ video into Rhino. Then, I selected the BREP and imported it into Ameba as a battery block, converting it into a triangular mesh.

Below, I will introduce the specific steps for you.， Configure Ameba for topology optimization. This will involve defining constraints, objectives, and other optimization parameters to meet my design requirements.

Importing the selected geometry into Ameba. Create mesh file from closed brep

Then set constraints for the supporting surfaces and three-dimensional coordinates. Because I do not want any displacement in the structure, I have set them to 0.

The third step is to set shape constraints, and here I encountered many problems. I will explain them in detail next.

Afterward, set the optimization parameters and specify the number of iterations.

Next is setting the material for predicting stress, and I chose ABS.

After logging into the account, I began the cloud computing process. This was my first time trying cloud computing, and I have to admit I felt a bit nervous when I pressed the "start" button.

![12.JPG](Project1%20a096d3095ef64721952cf988ac8629dc/12.jpg)

At this point, I set it for 109 iterations with 10,000 mesh faces to simulate. I also encountered some issues during the process.

![22222.jpg](Project1%20a096d3095ef64721952cf988ac8629dc/22222.jpg)

The first time, I didn't set bottom constraints, which resulted in a loss of form.

![111111.jpg](Project1%20a096d3095ef64721952cf988ac8629dc/111111.jpg)

After adding bottom constraints, I realized that the top constraints were not properly set either.

![15.JPG](Project1%20a096d3095ef64721952cf988ac8629dc/15.jpg)

So, at this point, I added a small battery block to address this issue.

![16.JPG](Project1%20a096d3095ef64721952cf988ac8629dc/16.jpg)

it worked much better.

![17.JPG](Project1%20a096d3095ef64721952cf988ac8629dc/17.jpg)

: Later on, I added multiple force constraints to ensure the accuracy of the calculation results.

![18.JPG](Project1%20a096d3095ef64721952cf988ac8629dc/18.jpg)

This is the final outcome.

![19.JPG](Project1%20a096d3095ef64721952cf988ac8629dc/19.jpg)

The generated mesh appears rough, likely due to the lower number of simulated faces.

![20.JPG](Project1%20a096d3095ef64721952cf988ac8629dc/20.jpg)

Now, smooth the model in Rhino.Then print them in the 3d printer.

**Speculations & Reflections**

For this project, I utilized the Grasshopper plugin Ameba, a specialized tool for conducting topology optimization using mechanics. Due to its reliance on cloud computing, it is highly lightweight. This optimization not only saved a significant amount of materials but also enhanced the structural aesthetics from a mechanical perspective.

**Conclusion + Feedback**

My fellow‘s feedback shows that my video voice is low, maybe I will check my microphone the next time…
